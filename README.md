## Visual Studio version

Version of Visual Studio which the Solution files use from the zips seems to be 2008.

## Phase II

See the PPT for info. Building up triangulations using the Random-Incremental Algorithm
discussed in class.

Phase II requires OpenGL, and thus requires GLUT.
If I recall correctly, the following links should be useful for installing GLUT on Windows.
http://user.xmission.com/~nate/glut.html for the files, and follow the instructions in the readme for it.
(Email for help if you're unsure about this).
